EAD Update Tool for CONTENTdm 6 Alan Witkowski (alan.witkowski@utah.edu)

********* Installation *********
1. Upload the EAD Tool code to a web accessible location on your contentdm 6
server. (e.g. /usr/local/Content6/Website/public_html/eadtool)

2. Rename config.template.php to config.php

3. Edit config.php to match the settings for your contentdm server.

4. Edit js/config.js for EAD configuration.

********* Usage *********
You must use a browser that supports HTML5 file drag-and-drop (tested with
Firefox 10+ and Chrome 17+). Currently Opera 11 and IE9 don't support that.

1. To load an XML file, drag the XML file from your file browser onto the
webpage. You can also drag in multiple XML files for batch processing.

2. The tool will attempt to look up the existing metadata based on the <unitid>
value in the XML. If a match is found, the green status box near the top will
notify you of the dmrecord # found.

3. The first column will show you the field names. The second column will show
you the data extracted from the EAD file. The third column (if an existing
record was found) will show the current values. The third column will also show
what has changed; additions are marked with green and deletions are marked with
red.

4. Currently the CONTENTdm catcher service doesn't support uploading
images/files, so adding new records with this tool is disabled.

5. Once you've reviewed the changes, click Submit Changes to upload them to the
server.

6. Upon success, you will be given a Transaction ID. All transaction IDs can be
viewed in the transaction log in the CONTENTdm admin section. The server will
also attempt to update the XML file on the server. This is done without the
catcher service and the web user will need access to the files where CONTENTdm
data is stored.

7. At this point you can continue to drag in more XML files. Simply drag them
anywhere on the webpage and they will be appended to the list.

8. Once you're finished, the collection will need to be indexed to view the
changes.
